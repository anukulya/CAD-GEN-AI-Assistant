Developed an advanced CAD AI assistant web application using Python, Flask-RESTful, and LangChain, enabling users to upload multiple engineering images and structured XML/JSON files for comprehensive 3D model analysis and consultation.
Integrated large language models (LLMs) with custom system prompts to interpret isometric views, extract geometric features, estimate dimensions, and parse structured data, delivering precise, hierarchical modeling instructions tailored for industry-standard CAD software.
Engineered robust data pipelines for real-time file handling, session-based conversation management, and persistent storage with SQLite, resulting in a scalable, extensible platform that streamlines technical CAD workflows and enhances engineering productivity through automated, expert-level guidance.
